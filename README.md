# # Practice Machine Learning Projects (Supervised)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I've created for practice. Each project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Projects

- **Customer_predict_tf.ipynb**
- **House_price_predeicting01.ipynb**
- **Predicting_Salaraies_using_DecisionTreeRregression_SVR_LinearRegression.ipynb**
- **Sleep_Disorder_Prediction.ipynb**
- **Wine_Quality_Predictintion.ipynb**

## Instructions for Running

To run these notebooks, you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Additionally, make sure to install any required Python libraries mentioned in the notebooks.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook you want to run.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code.

## Results
