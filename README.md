# # Practice Machine Learning Projects (Supervised)

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I've created for practice. Each project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Projects

- **Customer_predict_tf.ipynb**
- **House_price_predeicting01.ipynb**
- **Predicting_Salaraies_using_DecisionTreeRregression_SVR_LinearRegression.ipynb**
- **Sleep_Disorder_Prediction.ipynb**
- **Wine_Quality_Predictintion.ipynb**

## Instructions for Running

To run these notebooks, you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. Additionally, make sure to install any required Python libraries mentioned in the notebooks.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook you want to run.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the notebook file.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code.

## Results

Below are the key findings and outcomes of each project:

- **Customer_predict_tf.ipynb**: Describe the main results or predictions made in this project.
- **House_price_predeicting01.ipynb**: Summarize the findings related to house price prediction and model performance.
- **Predicting_Salaraies_using_DecisionTreeRregression_SVR_LinearRegression.ipynb**: Highlight the results obtained from predicting salaries using different regression techniques.
- **Sleep_Disorder_Prediction.ipynb**: Discuss the effectiveness of the sleep disorder prediction model and any insights gained from the analysis.
- **Wine_Quality_Predictintion.ipynb**: Provide an overview of the wine quality prediction results and the accuracy of the model.

## Future Work

Here are some potential improvements or areas for further exploration in each project:

- **Customer_predict_tf.ipynb**: Explore advanced neural network architectures or hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
- **House_price_predeicting01.ipynb**: Investigate additional features or consider more advanced regression models to enhance prediction performance.
- **Predicting_Salaraies_using_DecisionTreeRregression_SVR_LinearRegression.ipynb**: Experiment with ensemble methods or feature engineering techniques to improve salary prediction accuracy.
- **Sleep_Disorder_Prediction.ipynb**: Collect more diverse data and explore additional features that may contribute to better sleep disorder prediction.
- **Wine_Quality_Predictintion.ipynb**: Fine-tune the model parameters or consider incorporating domain knowledge to refine wine quality predictions.
